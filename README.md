# rheumatoid_arthritis

Eng. Mohamed helped in the frontend.

The project is under development. Each user has an ID, and the project collects data about the users to make a data set for RA as no data set for RA. It can help doctors and patients. The project's main idea is to 1- predict if the patient will get rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the future 2- diagnose RA 3- if the project predicted that a user will get RA in the future and that happened (as the project can diagnose and save data) the project will save that 4- Project raises the awareness about RA by providing recommendations for people who are predicted or diagnosed with RA.
